// Shared trust boundary for the three Cool Tunnel updaters that
// pull from GitHub releases:
//
//   - AppUpdater         → coo1white/cool-tunnel (the .app itself)
//   - NaiveUpdater       → klzgrad/naiveproxy     (the bundled `naive`)
//   - RustCoreUpdater    → coo1white/cool-tunnel  (the engine binary)
//
// Without these helpers, each updater previously relied on
// `URLSession.shared` defaults — which follow up to ~20 redirects
// to any host with no validation. SHA-256 manifest pinning (where
// it exists, currently only on AppUpdater) protects the *content*
// of the .zip but anchors trust in the manifest URL — and the
// manifest URL itself was being followed through unrestricted
// redirects until v0.1.7.11.
//
// What this module provides:
//
//   - `isTrustedGitHubURL(_:)`: HTTPS + host-suffix check.
//     Acceptable hosts: `*.github.com`, `*.githubusercontent.com`,
//     and the bare suffixes themselves. Used at the JSON-decode
//     seam (validate `browser_download_url` before any download)
//     and inside `GitHubRedirectGuard` for any HTTP redirect.
//
//   - `GitHubRedirectGuard.shared`: a stateless singleton
//     `URLSessionTaskDelegate` that constrains redirect targets
//     to the same host-suffix list. Pass to
//     `URLSession.shared.data(for:delegate:)` /
//     `URLSession.shared.download(for:delegate:)` (per-task
//     delegate, macOS 12+).
//
//   - `GitHubRedirectGuard.download(url:to:)`: full
//     host-validated, redirect-guarded download into a per-pipeline
//     `tempRoot`. NaiveUpdater + RustCoreUpdater share the
//     primitive; AppUpdater stays bespoke because it adds a
//     per-asset size cap (.sha256 1 MB / .zip 100 MB) that the
//     other two don't need.
